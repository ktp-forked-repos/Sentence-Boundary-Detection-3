1) A brief description of your own three additional features

* Left side word is a Stopword or not
* Right side word is a Stopword or not
* Length of Right side word < 3

2) How complete your program is? 

* Completed
* Implemented the program in python using pandas, NumPy, NLTK, Sklearn Libraries
* In the program, get_feature_vectors() function will extract all the 8 features from the data files and storing it in pandas dataframe.
* Command line arguments: sys.argv[1] holds SBD.train file and sys.argv[2] holds SBD.test file
* Modelled the decision tree classification on train data using Sklearn library and applied the implemented model to predict the labels for the feature vectors obtained from the examples in SBD.test.

> Accuracy of the System on the test data using all eight features

96.2% Accuracy


> Accuracy of the System on the test data using only 5 core features

89.5% Accuracy



> Accuracy of the System on the test data using 3 additional features

77.5% Accuracy
